              ProgramHead1="What exactly is the Learnbay industrial machine learning (ML) training course in Mumbai?"
              ProgramBot1="In one simple sentence, it’s the ladder of a successful, sustainable, and ever-growing ML career. Learnbay is a machine learning training based in Bangalore, providing high industry competent machine learning experts starting from 2016. Now, their machine learning programs are also available in Mumbai."
              ProgramBot2="The machine learning certification program offered by Learnbay in Mumbai is the best option for experienced working professionals who want a lucrative machine learning career switch. Even candidates with 8+ years of experience have also benefited from this institute. Learnbay machine learning institute in Mumbai is the best option among ML courses for working professionals."
              ProgramHead3="Why does Learnbay seem the best institute for earning industrial machine learning skills?"
              ProgramBot3="Learnbay offers an extensive degree of unique learning features or assistance along with the ultimate exposure to real-world artificial intelligence and machine learning problems. However, the three key matters that make Learnbay the best institute for learning ML are as follows:"
              ProgramHead4="Learn directly from industrial machine learning experts:"
              ProgramBot4="We have prepared world-class faculty that is composed of highly experienced instructors, mentors, and career counselors. All of them own more than 8 years of experience in different machine learning job roles, also from variable industrial domains. And it’s not like learning a boring learning experience through stacks of pre-recorded lectures and piles of old machine learning assignments- where you submit your tasks but get no feedback."
              ProgramHead5="Here you get domain-specific full-stack machine learning training."
              ProgramBot5="Learnbay machine learning program consists of 300 hours of live and interactive learning only. Even you get on-demand 1-on-1 doubt clearance sessions from the industry experts. Even the project sessions are completely live, and you get the advantage of learning industrial tricks and tips from the ML whizzes."
              ProgramHead6="Best possible flexible Learning Environment for working professionals:"
              ProgramBot6="Time management for the live or offline classes has become the greatest concern for working professionals. This is the key reason why about 70% of aspirants choose self-paced online machine learning courses. But Learnbay offers working professionals the opportunity of attending offline or Online Interactive Classes without disturbing their current job. The machine learning certification course in Mumbai comes with a 3-years of flexible subscription. Using such a subscription, you can change your batch and instructor and even pause/ resume your course completely hassle-free."
              ProgramHead7="Dedicated support to weak programmers:"
              ProgramBot7="Learnbay machine learning training program in Mumbai is specified for candidates with technical backgrounds. But it does not mean that everyone comes with a python or R programming expertise when joining the course. In fact, the lack of programming expertise is a key reason why a number of certified machine learning candidates in Mumbai are still jobless."
              ProgramBot8="Learnbay offers additional programming skills honing sessions with preparatory python and R classes along with exclusive hackathons."
              ProgramBot9="The machine learning course fee of this featured program in Mumbai is 95,000 INR."
              ProgramHead8="The course is also IBM certified."
              ProgramBot10="Know More about our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Training Program in Mumbai"
              DomainHead1="Why Domain Specialization?"
              DomainBot1="The Learnbay ML training program in Mumbai aims to build highly demanding machine learning engineers and machine learning experts as per the current competitive ML job market. As Ml is not a separate domain or a subject to generic machine learning skills are not at all going to help you get securely employed in the same. It seeks the most beneficial amalgamation of your ML knowledge along with a particular business field knowledge."
              DomainBot2="A master's degree in machine learning is completely worthless until you properly get trained on how to apply it in a specific industrial field like Supply chain, e-commerce, or Banking.

              ModuleBot1="The ultimate magic of this IBM machine learning course lies in this submodule designing and training execution. The course comprises 15+ modules that cover all the trending concepts and tools of ML. But it’s not like a random stuffing of demeaning ML tools and techniques. The submodules are well-planned to ensure a bottom-up training approach so that even a complete novice of programming and statistics can also learn with 100% efficiency. Apart from the advanced modules like Big data, Spark analytics, and NLP, Learnbay provides basic python and R-related modules too."
