              Course5="Data Science and AI master program"
              DomainHead1="Why Domain Specialization?"
              DomainBot1="Usually, Data scientists that specialize in a particular domain are mostly preferred by hiring Managers since they have a deeper understanding of the industry and the essential business concerns that must be addressed. Moreover, It is impossible to provide accurate insights unless one has a thorough understanding of the domain at hand. Thus, it is important to pick data science and AI courses that have domain electives options. In fact, although the most entry-level data science position is a bit manageable without core domain knowledge, mid to senior-level data scientist roles are not at all secure if you lack specific business knowledge."
