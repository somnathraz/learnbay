## Old School Project Management expertise Is Now outdated? But Businesses Saved And Revived By Data Science orientation.

Businesses have changed their work process; consumers have changed their consumption behavior. Accordingly, the service experience expectations of customers are also changing their directions. In one word, the entire business process has been changed.

So it’s quite obvious that the old-school project management tactics are not in a good scene anymore. Folks of prudent managers have already upgraded themselves with analytical skills and started implementing data science in management tasks. The outcomes of the same have been’ just wow.’

Wait… The above scenario is from a few years back. Now data science skill has become one of the measures for successful project managers.

Data is new energy. It has moon-shot sales and performance by integrating data science and AI into systems. It not only generates revenue. But even predicts consumer preferences and trends in the market. And that’s why a  project manager needs it so keenly. Ignoring the target customer orientation,  a manager can never complete a successful project.

Organizations are integrating data science into their business to simplify regular processes. To reach the most profitable outcomes within a targeted timeline, companies are now massively hiring  Data science managers or data science project managers. But wait, here, you might have a pinch of misconception. All the time, it’s not like a data science manager handles data science and AI projects only. Some companies hire for such a designation to make their normal business project highly data-driven and precise.

It is a well-known truth that modern businesses are completely about data. In the previous year,[ McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/the-big-data-revolution-in-us-health-care) estimated that the U.S healthcare system has reduced healthcare project management spending. $2.6 trillion baselines around 12-17% cost on earlier spending on the same. And big data is roughly costing $3.1 trillion a year to the U.S. Data science is not so easy to implement technically and financially as it needs a lot of investment. But yes, the ultimate gain is quite lucrative.
