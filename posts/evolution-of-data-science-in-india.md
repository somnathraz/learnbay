So yes, statistics is way older than what we think it could be. Before calculators, people used to count with their fingers, they couldn’t even imagine a machine performing mathematical intelligence. As people took baby steps in field of technology, invention of calculator resulted as a very useful and a greatest invention.

Ofcourse, when mathematics is present there will generally be a book like lodger to keep track of all the financial transactions, to analyze and to understand all the recorded transactions, there needed an organised methods of calculations.

The world changed since then, as Internet became popular, data started to generate and also many different industries came into existence. The main method of Data science in finding solutions is by analyzing the likes, expectations of people among the world and to create the product that will complement to it. This method has been being used by many popular industries so far. So the point is, Data Science is not a brand new concept to the world, it is just termed up to the combination of the concepts of business intelligence analytics and statistics. It was specially termed as “**Data Science**” because there is a pensive science put upon the piles of data to reduce them down to a reliable solution. Since it is all because of the data it is being gathered, it was named as so.

From the year _2000 _the internet users increased vigorously, and thus data started to generate. Rather to put the generated data into garbage, experts thought of looking deeper into that data in expectation of understanding what people actually needs. By this method of strategy the most popular Amazon.com[ website](https://www.theidioms.com/#) got started, the application went highly popular in US, so much popular and profitable that it started in many other countries.

India is yet still crawling towards the beam of Data science but it is surely progressing in its way. In past 5 years,_ hiring of Data scientists in India has been increased by 20%_, Data scientists are on high demand right now in India. So much that **Delhi**, the capital city is **paying 1.2 million annually for Data scientists**. As we all know **Bangalore** being the IT capital of India is** paying 1.1 million annually for data scientists.**

As demand for Data scientists got high, learning Data science  got a little tricky, because it was a new term of concept and there are still not much of university to offer course in Data science. But there are many Data science training institutes in India, 60% of such institutes in India is increased in past 2 years. Studying Data science is still slight tricky, since there are many institutes upon it, it is difficult to filter the right[ data science course](https://www.learnbay.in/shop/courses/data-science-training-courses-bangalore/).
