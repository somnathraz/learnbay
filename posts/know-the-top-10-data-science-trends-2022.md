#### Top 10 Trends of Data Science in 2022


###### 1. Augmented Data Analytics

Augmented Data Analytics is a type of data analytics that automates the analysis of massive amounts of data. Such analysis holds the blessings of NLP and advanced ML. It has eased the data scientist’s work process with real-time insights.

Augmented Data science or data analytics can merge data that is available inside an organization and the data from outside. The organization usually gets less time to process these data and extract any important insights. This data analysis provides deeper utterances and predictions by processing and preparing data and relevant visualization.

So many data analytics tools have been discovered in recent years based on business-specific visualization and explanation needs. It has been swiftly implemented in businesses, not just for data scientists but also for customers or service users. This made data analytics (Entry-level data science) and machine learning (Advanced-level data science) work together rather than operating them differently. In the next few years, you will see experts working more with Augmented analytics. Accordingly, there will be a surge in job openings in the same.

Because of the rapid evolution of this technology, augmented analytics modules are now required in all[ data analytics training programs](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/data-analytics-business-analytics-programs-for-professionals/), not just advanced data science courses.

###### 2. Work more on Actionable data insights.

Data software is expensive and investing in it without any meaningful insight or evaluation is time and money-consuming. So this is where working on actionable data insight is better. Big Data integrates with the system so they can make better decisions. These insights help



* Understand an organization’s difficulties
* Create new opportunities
* Study market trends.

Insights gained by actionable data can uplift an organization’s efficiency, work process, and scheduling of projects for different teams. Research by[ MIT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/feature/Developing-a-data-driven-culture-begins-with-enablement) stated that organizations that make data-driven decisions gain 4% in productivity and 6% in profit.


###### 3. Data Regulation

Application of data science Data privacy and rules have been regulated, such as data ethics and trust. It has become more prominent as governments issue new rules and regulations so that AI will get reinstated with more rules and regulations. Companies have to create AI solutions according to the new regulations set by the government. But the AI regulations by the government can create barriers to international collaboration. Top leaders and the government can schedule a meeting on how to apply new regulations and how it can change the use of data. They can work together to address a common issue that it faces as a government and even the company. Data security is a very delicate issue to handle. Both the bodies can easily come up with better regulation that is not just best for data security but even for the way data can be used by organizations for their business process.


###### 4. No code or Low code

Most organizations have integrated AI, and these organizations are using customized models. The key reason for model customization is reducing processing time. AI has initiated a lot of advancements in[ citizen development](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/citizen-development#:~:text=Citizen%20development%20is%20a%20business,platforms%20to%20create%20business%20applications.), anyone can become a Citizen developer, and this is because of AI with low code technologies. Citizen coders can look for problems in simple English, and AI will generate codes.

A TechRepublic poll resulted in over half of the companies have started using low-code and no-code in the operational process. 1/5th of the companies that have not started working with these trends in their system said they would do this in less than a year. So the adoption rate will gradually increase.


###### 5. Cloud AI and Data science

In the past few years, and mainly during the Covid-19  pandemic era, there has been a massive stroll-in Cloud-based solution. As a result, data is getting produced more enormously. Collecting, arranging, labeling, formatting, and analyzing data in one platform is a huge issue, and cloud-based AI is the only way to deal with the same. As different insights indicate, the upcoming 3-5 years will be too crucial for[ AI and Machine learning](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/artificial-intelligence-certification-course/). The cost of adopting AI has risen, and the developments of these technologies ensure cloud-based adoption in the future. So as the use of the cloud-based solution in various industries increases, the market will also expand with it. And obviously, professionals are working hard on reducing the cost of AI software development and implementation.


###### 6. Auto-ML

The method of installing machine learning models to real-world scenarios through automation is called AUTO-ML. It automatically selects, parameterizes, and constructs machine learning models. Machine learning becomes user-friendly when automated and provides more precise results than hand-coded methods. AutoML will give access to non-experts to create and deploy models. Don’t you think this is charming information for non-techies?


###### 7. Enhanced Natural Language Processing

The method of installing machine learning models to real-world scenarios through automation is called AUTO-ML. It automatically selects, parameterizes, and constructs machine learning models. Machine learning becomes user-friendly when automated and provides more precise results than hand-coded methods. AutoML will give access to non-experts to create and deploy models. Don’t you think this is charming information for non-techies?


###### 8. Automated Data Cleaning

Any data that is not cleaned before analysis is useless. These useless data can be redundant, inaccurate, and duplicated without any structure and format. The data retrieval process is slowed because of these unfiltered data. This results in a loss for businesses. Many organizations are searching for automatic data cleansing to improve data analytics to acquire better insights with big data. Data cleaning needs huge system support from artificial intelligence and machine learning.


###### 9. Blockchain

The utilization of decentralized ledgers makes managing vast amounts of data much easier. Due to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, data scientists can conduct analytics directly from their mobile devices. Because blockchain already tracks data’s origin, it’s much easier to validate the information.


###### 9. AI as a service (AIaaS)

It is an organization that provides a unique AI solution allowing its customers to implement AI techniques at a low cost. A few months ago, OpenAI said it would make GPT-3, a transformer language model, available to the public as an API.

It refers to businesses that customize AI solutions to help clients to implement and scale AI techniques at a low cost. Recently, OpenAI announced that it would make GPT-3, its transformer language model, available as an API to the public. AIaaS is one of the best cutting-edge models provided as a service.

The Future of AIaas technology will be divided into well-defined and self-contained functions. I.e., a manufacturing business will opt for one service to build a chatbot for internal communication and another for predicting inventory processes.
