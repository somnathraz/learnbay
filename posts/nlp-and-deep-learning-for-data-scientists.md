Deep learning and[ natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) (NLP and Deep Learning)are as busy as they’ve always been. The most in-demand technologies are deep learning and natural language processing (NLP). Advances in natural language processing and deep learning (NLP and Deep Learning) are produced nearly every day. Despite the fact that quarantine regulations in many nations have hampered numerous businesses, the[ machine learning](https://datascience-learnbay.medium.com/things-you-need-to-do-before-taking-machine-learning-or-data-science-coursehere-are-a-few-things-c302b1fce32a?source=user_profile---------8-------------------------------) industry continues to advance.

Aside from the fact that the Covid-19 has caused problems for a number of organizations, new-age tech skills such as Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Natural Language Processing (NLP and Deep Learning) is in high demand. For budding Data Scientists, here are some must-read publications. In this article, we at Learnbay try to go over some of the most crucial and current breakthroughs.


## How Deep Learning can keep you safe

Nukanj Aggarwal, ML Lead at Citizen, compiled a list of instances of how deep learning is being utilized to produce life-changing technology in his article that written. This article, ideally written by Citizen’s Machine Learning Lead, that shows how deep learning is being utilized to produce life-changing (or life-saving) technology.



* Citizen is nothing but a company that analyses first and foremost responder radio frequencies that using speech-to-text engines as well as convolutional neural networks.
* Citizen is a real-time emergency as well as safety alert app that quite notifies users of occurrences and crimes that have specially occurred in their neighborhood.
* The company has been able to expand its apps to a number of US cities.
* In the coming years, this technology could signify a significant shift in the police and first responder infrastructure.
* The NLP-driven has the ability to transform the police and response infrastructure dramatically.


## The Publication of the Open AI API

The publication of GPT-3 by Open AI was arguably the most significant development in the field of natural language processing this year. The API allows businesses and individuals to integrate OpenAI’s new AI technologies into their products and services. The publication of Open AI’s API, on the other hand, may have gone unnoticed by many.



* The API’s goal is technically keeps their focus on to provide users with access to future models built by the corporation, such as GPT-3.
* The API is general-purpose and can be used on nearly any natural language work; its success is inversely proportional to the task’s complexity.
* This is significant since it represents a departure from the company’s usual practice of open-sourcing its models (as they did with GPT-2)
* The company discusses why they opted to produce a commercial product this time, why they avoided open-source this time, and how they will manage any API misuse in the post.
* This official blog discusses how the corporation moved away from open source in order to prevent API exploitation


## IBM will no longer offer, develop, or research facial recognition technology

This official blog discusses how the corporation moved away from open source in order to prevent API exploitation. The CEO of IBM publicly indicated in a letter to Congress that the business would certainly be ceasing development as well as service offers of general-purpose facial recognition technologies and methodologies.



* [Artificial intelligence](https://datascience-learnbay.medium.com/data-scientist-vs-artificial-intelligence-engineer-which-is-a-better-career-choice-2aa261fb3707?source=user_profile---------18-------------------------------) advancements have substantially enhanced facial recognition software during the last decade.
* This was a significant step forward for the organisation, as well as a strong message to the[ data science](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/data-science-course-in-bangalore/) community at large.
* Face recognition technology will no longer be developed or researched by IBM, according to the company.
* IBM’s decision to prioritise ethics and safety may have influenced other large IT firms (including Microsoft) to follow suit.
* They feel that now is the right time to start a national conversation about whether and how domestic law enforcement organisations should use facial recognition methodologies.


#### Conversational AI: Neural Approaches

It examines neural approaches to conversational AI that have been developed in recent times as well. Audiences are interested in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.



* The researchers divided into three categories: question answering agents, task-oriented dialogue agents, and chatbots in this paper.

* An overview of state-of-the-art neural techniques is offered for each category, along with a comparison of them to traditional approaches, as well
* Its a discussion of progress made and obstacles still faced, using specific systems and models as case studies and sets.

It offers a coherent perspective as well as a full presentation of the key concepts and insights required to comprehend and develop modern dialogue agents that will be critical in making world knowledge and services accessible to millions of people in natural and intuitive ways.


#### Language Models Are Unsupervised Multitask Learners

Question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization are all examples of natural language processing (NLP) problems that are often ideally tackled using supervised learning on task-specific[ data models](https://datascience-learnbay.medium.com/top-5-data-collection-methods-process-a9e4099a7f15?source=user_profile---------1-------------------------------) as well.



* When trained on a new dataset of millions of online pages called WebText, the authors proved that language models began to learn these tasks without any explicit administration as well.
* The language model’s capacity is nothing but critical to zero-shot task transfer’s effectiveness just because of the increase whilst it certainly enhances performance in a log-linear pattern-wise across tasks.
* These findings point to a possible avenue for developing language processing algorithms that learn to fulfill tasks based on natural demonstrations.


## Generative Pre-Training Improves Language Understanding

The researchers discussed natural language processing and how discriminatively trained models can struggle to perform effectively in this paper published by OpenAI.



* Most deep learning approaches necessitate a large amount of manually labelled data, which limits their usefulness in many sectors where annotated resources are few.
* The approach’s effectiveness was technically proved on a numeric of natural language processing criteria, as according to the specific researchers.
* These target tasks do not have to be in the same domain as the unlabeled corpus in our configuration.

They suggested a broad task-agnostic model that beat discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically generated for each specific task in around 9 of the 12 tasks that studied, greatly outperforming the state-of-the-art. Their[ goal](https://datascience-learnbay.medium.com/what-is-the-future-of-data-science-f0313580bae1?source=user_profile---------3-------------------------------)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>is to learn a universal representation that can be used for a variety of tasks with minimum change.
