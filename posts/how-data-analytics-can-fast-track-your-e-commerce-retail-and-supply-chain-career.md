## What Role Does E-Commerce Play in the Post-Pandemic Retail Future?

Today’s retail data is exploding at a tremendous speed. Retailers are relying on data analysis, to turn insights into profitable margins by developing data-driven plans.  Owing to the growing volume of data, data scientists are higher in demand.

Some employees working in the e-commerce and retail industries are quite dissatisfied with their jobs. And wish to shift their profession without changing their domain. If you’re one of them, then you’re in the right place. If you[ love](https://www.theidioms.com/love/#) working with data and have some technical abilities, then[ Data science](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/different-job-roles-after-a-data-science-course/)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>can be the ideal choice for your career. 

In this article, we will look at the impact of[ Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/data-science-certification-courses/) in the retail and e-commerce industry, the challenges that come while implementing it, career scopes, and how you can get started as a data science professional in the same. 

**_People are still changing how they shop in early 2021, according to a survey from EY, which has been polling customers since the epidemic started. That’s about 80% of the people ([Digital Library](http://dl.lib.uom.lk/handle/123/16866))._** 60 percent of people no longer go to stores in person, and 43 percent are shopping more online for things they would have bought in stores before the pandemic. In Covid-19, many people don’t care where they are as long as they can connect to the web. **_People spent about $10 billion on e-commerce investments, acquisitions, and partnerships from May to July 2020 (by Kathy Gramling). This is about how much money they spent._** A lot of money was spent on logistics to make last-mile options like ghost kitchens and shadow storefronts possible. There was also a lot of money spent on AI and blockchain to make more things. Let us discuss data science in e-commerce, retail, and supply chain domain.

**_But do you know even after such massive demand so many retail and e-comm employees are losing their jobs?_**

                                                                               Source: Author

**_On the other hand, there is also an intelligent community of professionals to reach the top of success. And you can also be a part of that community. _**To know how, please continue reading this blog.

**                                                                            Image by Author**

**The final mile is crucial to[ e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce) success:** **_21% said they would not forgive stores and brands if service was delayed because of Covid-19._** It’s getting harder and harder for businesses to get last-mile delivery capacity because more people are shopping online. After Black Friday in 2020, many of us had to wait weeks for things to show up on our doorsteps. Delivery is now an important part of the whole experience. As a fulfillment center, the shop is used a lot. **_According to the Index, 37% of US customers plan to purchase online and pick up in-store more often in the future (online library)._** While using a shop as a fulfillment center may be a good idea, it needs systems and business divisions to work together to make the promise come true. Retailers’ ability to create a consistent experience must expand as services grow.

Retailers need to be ready to build better, deeper relationships with their customers, both online and in-person, no matter how people act.


## **For Retailers, the Future of E-Commerce is Bright**



* **Emerging Markets Will Be Critical**

In the future of eCommerce, India, China, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa are projected to play a key role. This may not be a surprise, but let’s look a little deeper into this. By 2022, it is expected that about 3 billion people from developing countries will be able to use the internet. That’s a lot of people who could be customers. There’s also a good chance that people who already live in these areas will make up 20% of total retail sales in 2022. A lot of people could buy this.



* **The Online vs. Physical Debate**

It’s not possible to talk about the future of e-commerce without talking about the conflict between physical and online shopping. In the long run, people buy things online more than they buy things in stores. It doesn’t mean that physical stores aren’t very important for internet businesses at all. People think brick-and-mortar stores aren’t as important anymore because they don’t have as many things as their online businesses, which usually have a lot more. **_Take a look at Nike_**, which has already opened stores in both New York and Shanghai. **_They’re called “Houses of Innovation,” or “Experiential Shops.” Overall, we believe that unique experiences will be the future of physical retail sites. These are once-in-a-lifetime events that cannot be duplicated._**


### **For Marketers, the Future of Ecommerce**



* **The importance of device use will increase.**

If you want to buy something from an e-commerce site, you usually have to use a computer to do it. It’s now on the other side. If you work for an **eCommerce Data Science company**, you have to make your[ website](https://www.theidioms.com/#) for mobile users before you make it for people who use their computers. This may seem to be an unusual shift, but it makes sense, particularly when you realize that 45 percent of all commerce choices were made on mobile devices last year. For comparison, it translates to $284 billion in sales. Buyers now want a seamless purchasing experience across all devices.



* **Video is becoming more popular.**

In the future, the video will play a big role in e-commerce. E-commerce businesses will need to improve their videography skills. Research says that 60% of people would rather watch a video about a product than[ read](https://www.theidioms.com/#) about it in a text. After watching a brand’s social videos, 64% of people buy something. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat may be to blame for these changes in buying habits. All of these apps have made changes that make video content more important.


### **How is data science affecting the retail industry?**

Data science is changing how people shop and how businesses order and ship things, say some retailers who are going in a different direction. Businesses can buy and ship things more cheaply because they don’t have to pay a lot for them. A lot of people have better experiences because of it. In the future, some algorithms can help retailers learn more about their customers and figure out how many people will buy in the future, too. It all helps the bottom line.


### **A Data Scientist’s Role in the Retail Industry**

Every year, the number, diversity, and usefulness of retail data increase dramatically. When retailers make decisions based on data, they use data science to make money. This is how businesses are using[ data science in retail](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/necessity-of-machine-learning-in-retail/) to stay competitive, improve customer service, and make more money and sales. And, as technology advances, data science in the retail business will have much more to give!

**                                                                             Image by Author**


### **What Role Does Data Science Play in eCommerce?**



* **Customer Lifetime Value:**

It is a prediction of how much money a single customer will make for a company over time. It is based on what the shopper has bought and done on a certain eCommerce site in the past.



* **Customer service has improved:**

Customer service is crucial for every eCommerce company owner. Business owners can use data science to make their websites better by getting feedback from people who use them and giving them stars and reviews. To figure out why people didn’t like them in the first place, you can sort them and do a Sentiment Analysis to figure out how they felt. E-commerce businesses can quickly look through all of the reviews and focus on improving and increasing customer happiness, with the issues raised by angry customers getting the most attention. This makes it easy for businesses.



* **Predictive Analytics:**

If you run an eCommerce site, you need to be able to figure out what people want before they do. This means that each person who goes to the site does things differently. They also have different preferences. Use Predictive Analytics to see everything about how customers use the site and what they buy. This makes it easier for them to make decisions. Consequently, **Data Science e-commerce businesses** may be able to better serve their customers and set a price range for their items.

The benefits of using and analyzing **data science in eCommerce** are endless, and understanding how customers use and interact with your website is critical to your success, so don’t forget to use it. If you want better customer service and a more personalized experience, you’ll need to get more information from people. You can also make more money, improve the prices of your products, and decide where to open a new store.


### **Data Scientists Who specialize in Supply Chain Data**

This means that more and more businesses see the benefits of using data science to manage their supply chains. This means that there is a growing need for data scientists who are qualified. Companies are paying data scientists a lot of money because there is a lot of demand for their services. It says that data scientists in the United States make an average of between $105,750 and $180,250 per year. Earnings are affected by factors like where you live, how much experience you have, and what kind of business you work in. According to statistics from other organizations, **supply chain data scientists** make an average of $82,100 per year, with some making as much as $156,000.


### **Supply Chain Management Using Data Science**
