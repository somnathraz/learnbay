The oil and gas sectors have been the most lucrative arena for most chemical engineers, petroleum engineers, mechanical engineers, and even geologists (petroleum). Not only the private occupations but also the government job scopes are quite high in this subject. But beyond all kinds of expectations, people in these industries are at significant risk of losing their employment. So what occurred all of a sudden!!

Well, no need to get panic. We all know that if one road gets blocked, certainly there are other ways to escape. Data Science and AI are the ultimate escape route from this roadblock. This blog talks about data science in energy, oil, and gas industry. But first, let’s have a look into the ‘what’s happenings?’’

<img src="/blog/energy-02.png" width="100%" /></img>


_According to PetroLMI, which provides industry labor market information, the unemployment rate, especially for oil and gas workers, peaked at 16.1% in 2020, 26% below 2014 levels. _People working in this industry are quitting by themselves due to the lack of growth. _People who have more experience are also not in the green zone._ What is important to keep your ground in the domain is the skills that you have. You need to keep upskilling only then you will be safe. Even the oil and gas industry lives and breathes on data and has been going digital as well. _It is very possible that not only will you retain your position in the industry but also have good pay as a[ Data science specialist](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/different-jobs-opportunities-of-data-science/)._

Data Science salary is a hot topic everyone thinks about when becoming a data scientist. We all have heard praises about how lucrative the DS field is. So much so that data scientists are notorious for being pompous. But I wouldn’t blame them. A data scientist makes big bucks in any and every domain. It is a very versatile field, and the domain-specific approach of specific organizations makes it a game-changer for many people looking to make that career switch.

Now that we have established that DS is a very profitable field and there is a need for it in any field, I would like to tell you something very particular. That is the importance of data science in energy, oil, and gas industry. So let us start by asking some critical questions.


## Use of Data Science in Energy, Oil, and Gas Industry

The oil and gas industry misses boats in data science, a reinterpretation of the inherent value of data and its strategic assets. Like other industries, today’s oil and gas industry is looking for ways to improve efficiency, thereby reducing operating costs and increasing revenue.

However, oil and gas companies are also subject to exceptional safety, environmental, and regulatory reporting requirements in contrast to many industries. Therefore, data science has many advantages that can help improve data efficiency and increase sales when adopted in the industry. With this, I think you can make out that DS is essential in the domain we are talking about.


## Need for Data Science in the Energy domain



* The amount of data in the oil and gas industry increases exponentially due to advances in information technology.
*  This includes everything from sensor recording during exploration, drilling, production, and seismic manipulation to in-drill logging (LWD) technology that enables real-time recording of drilling data.
*  Also includes fiber optic solutions that provide a wide range of data on environmental conditions such as temperature, oil reserves, equipment performance, and condition. Managing this data and using it as a strategic asset can significantly impact its financial performance.
* The plunge in oil prices has forced oil and gas companies to go beyond traditional methods to seek broader changes in business practices to improve performance and reduce costs.
* Better data analysis and technology are essential in determining the success of oil and gas companies.


## Advantages of Data Science in the Energy, Oil and Gas Industry.

As of now, we have established that data science has found its uses in various fields. That is because the DS has multiple advantages no matter where you want to use it. Such is the malleability of this field. It has numerous advantages in any field that it steps foot in.

Here are some high-level examples of how data science can help the oil and gas industry. 


<img src="/blog/energy-04png" width="100%" /></img>




* Exploration and Discovery-Geological data such as seismic data and rock types in nearby drilling holes can predict oil pockets.
* Production Accounting-You can link production data to alarms. 
* Drilling and Completion-Predictive Analytics can use geological completion and drilling data to determine preferred and optimal drilling sites. 
* Equipment Maintenance-Compare real-time streaming data from oil rigs with past drills to better predict and avoid problems and understand operational risk. These examples show the operational goals of oil and gas data science. 

 As with other technological advances, there are barriers to the successful use of data science: (Disadvantages)



* _Taxing Compute Resources_-You may not have enough resources to store and  process large amounts of structured and unstructured data.  
* Poor data quality-Data is stored in multiple locations and can be subject to inconsistent governance. 
* Incorrect Modeling– The correct question may not have been asked or misunderstood.
* Relentless Corporate – C-suite support is essential from the start. Communication between employees, SMBs, and data scientists is essential.
* Talent Gap: Data science and data engineering talent is new to the oil and gas industry. These skills are still under development, and it can be challenging to put together the right team.


## Projects To Level Up Your Resume

When we talk about entering into a specific specialization job market, it is essential to have the proper skills displayed on your resume that make you fit for the role. The best way to achieve that is through projects. These are some of the Oil and Gas domain-based projects that you can do to become a DS specialist in the field.



* _Prediction of cost overruns in Oil and Gas Engineering_
* _Developing a Failure Prediction Model_
* _Model for determining the optimum and efficient use of machines._


## What are companies hiring for Energy, oil, and gas data scientists?

Data science, a versatile field, is also very lucrative for various fields and companies. These are some of the oil and gas companies that are looking for data scientists.

Now that the whole domain is sorted. Let us come to the salaries that you have been waiting for. Brace yourself for the mind-blowing information you will be bombarded with.


## How much do data scientists earn with different variables?

Since we will primarily be discussing the pay range and living of a data scientist, let us see exactly how much data scientists in different roles and fields earn.

On average, it is estimated that a fresher in data science earns about Rs.6,98,412 as base pay in a year. This is subject to variation with every organization. However, the figures will be more or less near to the given value. Let’s see how much DS can get you according to your experience in the field.

_Based on Experience_



* Freshers: The average income of entry-level data scientists is Rs 511,468 per year for recent graduates.
