The Supervised Unsupervised And Reinforcement Learning algorithm is widely used in the industries to predict the business outcome, and forecasting the result on the basis of historical data. The output of any supervised learning depends on the target variables. It allows the numerical, categorical, discrete, linear datasets to build a machine learning model. The target variable is known for building the model and that model predicts the outcome on the basis of the given target variable if any new data point comes to the dataset.

The supervised learning model is used to teach the machine to predict the result for the unseen input. It contains a known dataset to train the machine and its performance during the training time of a model. And then the model predicts the response of testing data when it is fed to the trained model. There are different machine learning models (Supervised Unsupervised And Reinforcement Learning)that are suitable for different kinds of datasets. The supervised algorithm uses regression and classification techniques for building predictive models.

For example, you have a bucket of fruits and there are different types of fruits in the bucket. You need to separate the fruits according to their features and you know the name of the fruits follow up its corresponding features the features of the fruits are independent variables and name of fruits are dependent variable that is out target variable. We can build a predicting model to determine the fruit name.

There are various types of Supervised learning:



1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. Decision tree
4. Random forest
5. support vector machine
6. k-Nearest neighbors

Linear and logistic regression is used when we have continuous data. Linear regression defines the relationship between the variables where we have independent and dependent variables. For example, what would be the performance percentage of a student after studying a number of hours? The numbers of hours are in an independent feature and the performance of students in the dependent features. The linear regression is also categorized in types

those are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression. 

Classification algorithms help to classify the categorical values. It is used for the categorical values, discrete values, or the values which belong to a particular class. Decision tree and Random forest and KNN all are used for the categorical dataset. Popular or major applications of classification include bank credit scoring, medical imaging, and speech recognition. Also, handwriting recognition uses classification to recognize letters and numbers, to check whether an email is genuine or spam, or even to detect whether a tumor is benign or cancerous and for recommender systems.

The support vector machine is used for both classification and regression problems. It uses the regression method to create a hyperplane to classify the category of the datapoint. sentiment analysis of a subject is determined with the help of SVM whether the statement is positive or negative.

Unsupervised learning algorithms

Unsupervised learning is a technique in which we need to supervise the model as we have not any target variable or labeled dataset. It discovers its own information to predict the outcome. It is used for the unlabeled datasets. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning methods. It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual intervention.

For example, We have a bucket of fruits and we need to separate them accordingly, and there no target variable available to determine whether the fruit is apple, orange, or banana. Unsupervised learning categorizes these fruits to make a prediction when new data comes.

Types of unsupervised learning:



1. Hierarchical clustering
2. K-means clustering
3. K-NN (k nearest neighbors)
4. Principal Component Analysis
5. Singular Value Decomposition
6. Independent Component Analysis

Hierarchical clustering is an algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It begins with all the data which is assigned to a cluster of their own. Here, two close clusters are going to be in the same cluster. This algorithm ends when there is only one cluster left.

K-means and KNN is also a clustering method to classify the dataset. k-means is an iterative method of clustering and also used to find the highest value for every iteration, we can select the numbers of clusters. You need to define the k cluster for making a good predictive model. K- nearest neighbour is the simplest of all machine learning classifiers. It differs from other machine learning techniques, in that it doesn’t produce a model. It is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure.

[PCA(Principal component analysis)](https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm. For example, you have a dataset with 200 of the features/columns. You need to reduce the number of features for the model with only an important feature. It maintains the complexity of the dataset.

Reinforcement learning is also a type of Machine learning algorithm. It provides a suitable action in a particular situation, and it is used to maximize the reward. The reward could be positive or negative based on the behavior of the object. Reinforcement learning is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior in a situation.

Main points in Reinforcement learning –



* Input: The input should be an initial state from which the model will start
* Output: There are much possible output as there are a variety of solution to a particular problem
* Training: The training is based upon the input, The model will return a state and the user will decide to reward or punish the model based on its output.
* The model keeps continues to learn.
* The best solution is decided based on the maximum reward.
