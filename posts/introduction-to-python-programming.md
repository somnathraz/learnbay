### [What exactly is Python?](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/#:~:text=Python%20is%20an%20interpreted%2C%20object,programming%20language%20with%20dynamic%20semantics.&text=Python's%20simple%2C%20easy%20to%20learn,program%20modularity%20and%20code%20reuse.)

Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language that belongs to high-level programming language divisions. Python is commonly used for application development because it supports object-oriented programming approach.


### Why is Python so well-likely?

The one-line response is ‘widely accessible’ and has a ‘simple syntax’. Yes, not a single programming language has the same level of accessibility and ease of use as Python. Python’s syntaxes give natural language a lot of weight, making it easier to understand and work with, and making it sound more like human communication language. As a result, it has stayed in the top five programming languages preferred by software engineers, application developers, and other techies for the past few decades.

But, since the last few years, crossing the circumference of popularity, Python has become a global craze irrespective of demographic, professional, and generation-related limitations.


### [Why should you learn Python in 2021?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-you-should-learn-python-in-2021/#:~:text=Python%20has%20a%20very%20simple,is%20comparatively%20easier%20to%20learn.&text=Also%2C%20you%20need%20to%20know,and%20high%2Dlevel%20programming%20language.)

Python programming is now the fifth fundamental need to live in this real world, after food, water, air, and shelter.

It may sound diplomatic or even crazy, but it’s the fact. Let’s have an inside look at why it’s so important to learn Python?



Use of Python is industry-independent:-Every industry needs Python. Most industries like BFSI, healthcare, sales and marketing, even education and research industries are becoming highly dependent on python programming.The example I will give here will certainly make you realize how powerful Python programming industrial reaches. 
Skilled growth marketers, who once relied solely on simple analytical skills and advanced Excel expertise, now have little value in the marketing industry unless they know Python. 
Yes, nowadays, python-driven researches are used to make the majority of growth marketing decisions. As a result, Python is clearly embedded in every area of the industrial sector, regardless of domain. 
You can visit python.org’s Success story page to the ultimate power of Python across multiple industries. 
But why the sudden popularity?
Python is a foundational language of data science:-Data science- the major cause of Python’s cross-industrial demand surge. 
Initially, R used to be the backbone of data science. Still, with the advancement of data science and its applicability, the complexity of R became a sound barrier for the data science field. Simplicity and a wider range of accessibilities promoted Python as the successful replacement of R in the world of data science. 
With the advancement of[ AI and Machine Learning](https://marutitech.com/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/), Python achieved more credibility within the last few years. The most widely used software and application packages like ‘pandas’, ‘NumPy’, ‘Matplotlib’, ‘pyspark’, ‘Keras’, ‘Scikit-learn’, ‘PyTorch’, etc., all are developed using python programming. 
Such applications and libraries are very efficient for handling larger amounts of data, even by non programmers. As these are inbuilt libraries within Python, other than the application usage knowledge, no core programming or coding proficiency is needed. These applications have strong algorithmic abilities, making a person with only basic knowledge of statistics and complex mathematics impressively eligible to do a data analytics job. This is why Python is called ‘A programming language built for everyone’ and is making the future of data scienceIt’s going to be most demanding skills in the future job market:-While data science has become the hottest topic in the global job market, the demand for python programmers are increasing silently. 
Why so? 
Well, everybody is now focusing on the data science career switch. Professionals without technical backgrounds target the basics of python programming and jump into the data science tools and technologies. But from where are these tools technologies coming? 
Yes, these are the output of so many python programmer’s hardships. Hence, while the key focus is now on data scientist and data scientist courses, the hidden job opportunities are very high for python programmers. On LinkedIn.com, at present, almost 528,242 python jobs are available worldwide. The number is increasing by at least 10% every day.So, suppose you hold a technical background or a student. In that case, it’s best for you that you focus on earning experience (for working professionals) or degrees in core python programming (for students)Python programmers are well compensated. 
Python developers earn around 7 to 18 lakhs/year (6 t0 ten years of experience) as base salary with additional compensation of almost the same amounts in India. This is quite high in comparison to other programming developers like PHP, Java, C++, etc. Even SMEs are offering an average of 2 to 3 lakhs salary package to freshers.

### What are the uses of python Software?

Python software can be used in a variety of ways, as previously mentioned.The fields and tasks for which python software is widely used are listed below.

### [Features of Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-features/)

It’s simple to understand, read, and write. 
Syntaxes used in python programming are more like natural language/ human language (like English). For example, to print ‘Learnbay- The Data Science & AI Institute, ‘we have to just type print(“[Learnbay](https://www.learnbay.co/data-science-course/)– The Data Science & AI Institute”) in python editor or any IDLESmart in memory management 
Python offers you a stress-free programming experience concerning memory. This programming software comes with efficient auto-memory management features that periodically clean the memory by itselfFree to use and open source 
No purchasing cost or subscription cost is required for downloading and using Python.you can use Python at zero cost for a lifetime. And due to its open-source licensing features, you can share this software, among others. Even, can modify the source code as per your project requirementCross-platform performance 
Python has compatibility with most operating systems like Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix, etc. 
Until now, you have learned plenty of basic information about python programming. So, you might have a question in mind when you are aware of the ease of use.


### Can I learn Python on my own?

Yes, of course. Plenty of python learning videos are now available over the internet. A few of the reliable options are Codecademy, Learnpython.org, LinkedIn python learning courses, etc. you can download Python for free[ here .](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

These are only for gathering a basic stage of knowledge. If you have data science career transition planning, you must choose a creditable course featured with real-time industrial projects.
