            <p className={styles.top}>6. DATA SECURITY</p>
            <p className={styles.bot}>You understand that we cannot ensure the safety of your data forever and that safety is better than many other security systems. We will do our best to make sure we protect your data, but it might become accessible in some cases. Neither humans nor security systems are perfect. People may take intentional steps against you, but we will try our best to help you as a company.</p>
            <p className={styles.top}>7. THE IMPORTANCE OF AFFILIATES-</p>

            <p className={styles.bot}>The Data Protection Officer, the Governance Group, and any pertinent business area will perform routine examinations on how we collect, store and share personal data.

            <p className={styles.top}>9. How do we store data?</p>
            <p className={styles.bot}>Complying with information legislation without a strong records management policy and procedures is impossible.

            <p className={styles.bot}><b>THE DURABILITY OF DATA STORAGE:</b></p>
            <p className={styles.bot}>When we no longer need your data, we either remove it from our system, grossly oversimplify it so we can no longer identify you, or retain it to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. Your personal information will only be kept for the length of time that is required for us to serve you and achieve the stated objectives of this policy.</p>
            <p className={styles.top}>10. DATA PROTECTION</p>

            <p className={styles.bot}>When you pay for something on our Website, your private information won't be stored anymore after the transaction. However, we can't promise that other people won't have access to your data or computer, which could cause it to be exposed publicly.</p>
